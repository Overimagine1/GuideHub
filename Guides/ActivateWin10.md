#  How to Activate Windows 10/11!
-> *This is a [GuideHub](https://rentry.co/GuideHub) guide.* <-

!!! danger Please disable any anti virus before doing this
    Some anti-viruses that aren't defender may interfere with the activation, so disable them just to be safe.

!!! info You need an archive-extracting program for this
    Due to Window's archiver having no support for .7z files, you need to use a file extracting program, such as [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).

##🔐 The Tutorial
1. Go to https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts/releases
2. Once you go there, select the .7z file as the download (If there is a newer version then 1.4 then use that instead)
3. Save it wherever, I’d do it on the desktop for easier access.
4. Once you have the file installed, right click and extract it.
5. Put the password in. The password is 1234
6. There will be two folders, All-In-One-Version and Separate-Files-Version. We are going to be doing the All-In-One-Version since it's easier to use, so go in the All-In-One-Version folder.
7. Open the `.bat` file that's in there.
8. Select HWID (1) then HWID Activation (1)
9. Let the script activate windows
10. Enjoy Windows 10 activated.
